ZSHRC
=====
My ZSHRC configuration.

## WHY
Because I wanted to share, my configuration.

## Philosophy
I spend most of my time in a shell, so I need to keep it clean and efficient.

## Features
- Use powerline so you *need* a patched font.
- Use Antigen to keep everything in a module as far as I can.
- Completion of the command is fuzzy by fzf.

## INSTALL
```
# Clone the repo on your machine.
$ git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeSeren/zshrc ~/.zsh
# Add a symbolic link to the zshrc file.
$ ln -s ~/.zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
# Reload your shell
. ~/.zshrc
```
